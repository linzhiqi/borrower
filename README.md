borrower
========

web application helps borrower return things in time

Example site:
chinesemonster.serveblog.net:8080/borrower <br>
note: because Facebook think all hosts on serveblog.net(No-IP's domain name) is malicious, it reject it as a callback url. So for this deployment, facebook signup does not work.
