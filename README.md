borrower
========

web application helps borrower return things in time
<p>
Example site:
<font color="blue">chinesemonster.serveblog.net:8080/borrower</font>
</p>
<P>
Note: because Facebook think all hosts on serveblog.net(No-IP's domain name) is malicious, it reject it as a callback url. So for this deployment, facebook signup does not work.
